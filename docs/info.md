## How it works :)

Simple 4 bit carry adder with no initial carry-in. Inputs A/B0 reference bit 0, A/B1 reference bit 1 and so forth. Output O0 reference output bit 0, O1 reference output bit 1 and so forth. 

## How to test

Simply connect VCC to some of the input pins and scope the output pins. 

## External hardware

Attach one LED to each output - dependent on the choice of LED a resistor in series can also be included. To make testing easier, switches can be connected to the input pins.
